### Hi, this is JTO, a university graduation simulator
Your university may provide a system for checking the graduation conditions. Our university, KAIST, also provides a [graduation management system](https://gradreal.kaist.ac.kr) which is not user-centric, hard to simulate, and not proper to plan the future.

However, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the graduation planning. Not only for the last-year students, but for the freshman, it is necessary to balance the load or plan the courses. Thus, we present JTO, which helps students fully manage their school life.

## On-Service Universities
Oups. Nothing :P

## Plan-To-Serve Universities
* [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/)

## How to run the project?
This project requires the NO-SQL database for storing JSON format. Set your database URL in ```.env``` file, and type
```
yarn
yarn start
```
for development purpose only.

## How to contribute?
Thank you for your kindness. However, this is the very first step of development, so we don't get the contribution. Whenever we are ready, we will open the way to contribute!

### Now, there are three members contributing the service, thank you
